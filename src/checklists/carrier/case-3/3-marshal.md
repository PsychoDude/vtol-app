# CASE 3 Marshal

- The marshal stack is a counterclockwise orbit.
- When viewed with the radial pointing up (towards the boat, i.e. “up” is the heading of the radial), the three o’clock position of the orbit is aligned on the radial.
- The stack can be entered from any direction.
- When cleared by CATCC for a CASE 3 recovery, you must exit at the three o’clock position. When leaving the stack for a CASE 3 you are required to notify CATCC by making a “Commencing” call.
- The overview for the stack and approach pattern can be found the image below.
- Each solid horizontal line on the horizontal view and dashed vertical line on the vertical view indicate a radio call. “IAF” is “Platform,” “10 DME” is “See you at 10,” “6 DME” is “ICLS Lock-On,” and “3 DME” is “Approaching Glidepath.”
- Lines above and below altitudes indicate ceiling and floors. So, between 3 DME and 6 DME the floor is 600’ and the ceiling is 1,200’.
