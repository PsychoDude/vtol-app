# CASE 3 Standard Approach Checklist

## Needles/ICLS

1. When cleared for a CASE 3, leave the stack flying down the marshal radial and begin a 4,000FPM descent at a speed of 300KTS.
2. Once you pass through 5,000ft, call “Platform” and shallow the descent to 2,000FPM.
3. Level off the descent at 1,200ft and slow to 250kts.
4. At 10nmi from the carrier, call “See you at 10” and set your CRS knob to the Final Bearing. Adjust your heading if necessary (should only be an issue in the rare occasion that the final bearing is not the marshal radial).
5. At 6nmi from the carrier, CATCC will clear you for “ICLS Lock-On.” At this point, you must open your comms menu and request landing from the AI ATC. Keep the menu open.
6. Around 5-5.75nmi, the needles will show up on the HSI. Call “ICLS Lock-On” and the position of the needles (ex. Up and on). Dirty up and slow to 200kts. Cancel your landing request in the comms page.
