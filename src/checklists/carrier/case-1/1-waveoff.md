# CASE 1 Bolter & Wave Off Procedures

- Sometimes the LSO will deem the approach to be unsafe. When this is the case, LSO will call: “Wave off! \[Reason]” The LSO does not need to give any reason.
- When you are waved off, always follow the instructions of the LSO!
- When a bolter occurs or when you are waved off, you are to:

  1. climb to 800 feet
  2. extend from the carrier
  3. turn left to the downwind (Related Checklists).

- When you reach final again, call the ball again so the LSO knows you are attempting another landing.
