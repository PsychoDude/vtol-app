- The marshal stack is a 6 mile wide counterclockwise orbit at 3000 feet and 350 knots. The 3 O’clock position of this orbit is directly above the carrier’s right side.
- The stack can be entered from any direction.
- When cleared by CATCC for a CASE 1 recovery, you must exit at the 9 O’clock position. When leaving the stack for a CASE 1 you are required to notify CATCC by making a “Breaking the deck” or “Commencing” call.
