**DESCRIPTION:**
The Frequency Vs Azimuth Display (FRAZ), commonly pronounced “Freak-Az” by aircrew, gives the operator situational awareness on the frequency (Y-Axis) and azimuth (X-Axis) of detected emitters. Jammers can also be cued and managed through the FRAZ.

> **NOTE:**

<div class="border-s-4 border-green-500 ps-4 mb-5"> 
Most fire control radars generally operate in the mid-band, and  STTs cause the radar to jump up to the high-band. This quirk of radar operation is a good way to tell on the FRAZ which emitters are locking up the aircraft
