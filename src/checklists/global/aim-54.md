# AIM-54

The AIM-54 Phoenix is a long range ARH missile, seen exclusively on the EF-24G. Compared to the AIM-120 its function is identical, yet it has significantly longer range, higher speed, and significantly worse maneuverability. It can be a struggle to _G-pull_ at times as its lack of maneuverability keeps it from easily being set up for G-pulling. It is typically used within BVR to apply pressure at long ranges, and is notably useful for engaging AWACS at long ranges.
