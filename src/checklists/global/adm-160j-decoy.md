# ADM-160J Decoy Mode

Decoy mode is the “classic” MALD mode where the missile will utilize SAS jamming to appear as a different contact type on radars. This allows it to be targeted and engaged rather than you or your flight. Covering the MALD with support jamming can further increase the confusion.

Usage:

1. Select the MALD you wish to update
2. Press “DECOY”
3. Choose the airframe for the MALD to mimic
4. If deployed: Press “UPDATE”
