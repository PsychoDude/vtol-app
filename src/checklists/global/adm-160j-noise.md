# ADM-160J Noise Mode

Noise mode allows the MALD to transmit typical barrage jamming against up to two targets. The primary advantage of this as opposed to jamming targets yourself is the risk of HOJ is no longer present.

Usage:

1. Select the MALD you wish to update
2. Press “NOISE”
3. Select the correct frequency band for your target
4. Choose a targeting mode:
   1. AUTO - MALD selects based off _RWR_ pings
   2. TSD - Targets active _TSD_ selection
   3. GPS - Targets current _GPS_ point
   4. TGP - Targets what you have locked with _TGP_
