# Noise Jamming Effects

- **Air To Air Radar:** Noise jamming on radar will appear as multiple green bricks, affectionately referred to as “poop bricks”. Operators are able to select the jamming bricks to initiate a HOJ sequence. True radar contacts will be hidden within the noise, and will not appear until burn-through range.
- **Air To Ground Radar:** Noise jamming on the high band will heavily disrupt the radar ground mapping of the AH-94. The range that the FCR can detect ground units will also be decreased.
- **Terrain Following:** Noise jamming on the high band will disrupt the terrain following radar of cruise missiles, degrading its navigation.
- **Communications:** Low band jamming will jam any radio communications transmitting to the target; leading to comms sounding like static for the recipient. Note that friendly aircraft comms can also be affected by friendly jammers.
- **GPS:** Low band jamming will jam the reception of GPS for both friendlies and combatants. If GPS is jammed, the jammed aircraft, cruise missile, or bomb will fall back on INS for guidance. While not as detrimental for aircraft, GPS jammed munitions have an increased likelihood of missing their intended target due to INS drift.
