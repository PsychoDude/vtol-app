# Dynamic Launch Zone

The ranges that a missile can travel depends pretty heavily on the given situation. Variables that affect missile range can include your altitude, speed, angle off, and pitch. That said, missile range also depends on the same variables for the enemy. For example, an enemy traveling towards you is easier to hit than an enemy traveling away from you. This is because the missile has to travel farther and chase the enemy instead of just ramming straight into them.

Because of the wild changes in range and capability of the missile, the aircraft determines the capable range using sensors such as the radar. It displays this information on the HUD (and in some cases the HMCS too). This symbology is called the Dynamic Launch Zone, or DLZ. It is displayed on the bottom right side of the HUD as a vertical line and box. The upper horizontal line is called Rmax, or the maximum range the missile is capable of hitting the target. The lower horizontal line is called Rmin, or the minimum range a missile can hit the target. The DLZ is split up into two areas, those being the upper singular line and the lower hollow box. The upper line represents the range at which a missile will hit the target as long as the target does not maneuver from its current attitude and position. The lower hollow box represents the No Escape Zone or NEZ. This represents the range at which a missile has the energy needed to hit the target even if it maneuvers and changes position. This does not mean that a missile shot in this range canâ€™t be defended or pulled, just that it is no longer possible for the target to run away from the missile.
