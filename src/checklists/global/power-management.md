# Jamming Power Management

Increasing the power to a jammer transmitter has different
effects depending on the jamming mode.

- **Noise:** Increases the raw power transmitting from the pod. Creating more noise on the threat radar’s scope and decreasing burn-through range.
- **DRFM:** Creates more fake contacts on the threat radar’s scope and increases effectiveness of RGPO
- **SAS:** Increases the detection range that the SAS jamming aircraft appears on threat radars. With this in mind, it may be advantageous to lower the SAS power output to appear at more reasonable ranges
