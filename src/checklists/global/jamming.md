**Types of EWAR**

Electronic warfare (EW) is the Discipline of warfare that covers the electromagnetic spectrum including Radars, Radios, Navigation Equipment, Datalinks, and other EM Equipment. EW is made up of 3 Sub Disciplines

- Electronic Attack (EA) - Degradation of enemy EM equipment
- Electronic Protection (EP) - Defense from enemy electronic attack
- Electronic Support (ES) - Classification and analysis of enemy use of the EM Spectrum

The scope of this document is the principles and employment of electronic attack as it pertains to the EF-24G and may not entirely be true to real EA

**Frequency Bands**

The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. Including radio waves, visible light, and gamma radiation. Electronic Warfare is mainly concerned with the radio spectrum, which is composed of frequencies ranging from 3Hz to 3,000 GHz. These frequencies are normally organized into “bands”.

Each band of frequencies have pros and cons, and are used for
different applications.

- Low Band (30hz-2GHz): Generally used for early warning radars or long-range communications. Low band radars have an incredibly long range, but relatively low fidelity on tracks.
- Mid Band (2GHz-8GHz): Generally used for medium-range search radars
- High Band (8GHz-27GHz): Generally used for high-resolution radar tracking. The fidelity of high frequency radar is ideal for missile guidance, missile warning systems, and ground mapping.

In the same way that humans can only see visible light, radio wave devices are only able to see signals within their frequency band. Any attempts of jamming a system with the wrong frequency band will have little to no effect on the threat system. I.E, low-band noise jamming will not affect a high-band fighter radar.
