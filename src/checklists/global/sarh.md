# Semi-Active Radar Homing Missiles

## “Fox 1”

Semi-Active Radar Homing missiles are an older technology radar missile. It's generally advised to not use this missile when better alternatives are available such as the _AIM-120C/D_. From the point of launch to the point of impact, the missile relies on the constant lock of the launching plane to track and hit its target. If the plane loses lock of the enemy a single time, the missile is immediately trashed. Air to Air SARHs are generally very unmaneuverable, being outmaneuvered by a 9G pull. They travel somewhat long distances. You'll see this missile in the form of the _AIM-7_.

## AIM-7

The AIM-7 Sparrow is a Semi-Active Radar Homing missile. Wihin VTOL VR, it is seen as a “low-tech” armament due to its semi-active nature. It offers a unique advantage over AIM-120s in that it does not produce a radar emission, making it difficult to _G-Pull_ at long ranges. Because of this advantage, it is typically seen in small amounts on competitive loadouts, mostly as a distractive measure as the most surefire way to defend it is to notch or chaff the attacking aircraft. It can be used to force a competent player to turn defensive, allowing you to gain a better position or press an advantage.
