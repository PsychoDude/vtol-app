# GPS Guided Bombs

GPS-Guided bombs are best suited for precision strike roles, with the GBU-38 acting as a great bunker-buster, and the GBU-39 being able to take out long-distance targets with ease. The one downside of GPS-guided bombs is that due to their use of fixed coordinates, they are completely ineffective when being used against moving targets. GPS-Guided bombs can also disable their guidance package entirely through the SMS page, essentially serving as a dual-purpose weapon and making unguided bombs obsolete.
