# Unguided Bombs

Unguided bombs perform well against fixed targets like bunkers due to their heavier payload. They also work well as a suppression weapon; able to be fired repeatedly to decimate a large area of targets. If need be due to budget or other reasons, unguided bombs can be used for the purpose that GPS-Guided bombs fill - a precision strike weapon. While not recommended, it is possible with the use of the Continuously Computed Release Point mode (CCRP AUTO).
