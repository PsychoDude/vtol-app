# AIM-120C/120D

The AIM-120 is an active radar homing missile, and is the main long range air to air missile seen within VTOL VR. There are two variants, that being the AIM-120C and the AIM-120D.

The AIM-120C is seen on the F/A-26B and the T-55. It one shots targets and burns for about 3.8 seconds. It is easily _G-pulled_ due to its ARH nature and its tendency to remain burning in close-in fights.

The AIM-120D is the same as the 120C except having more maneuverability, more burn time, and datalink capabilities. It is seen on the F-45A and the EF-24G.
