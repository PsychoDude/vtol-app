# Laser Guided Missiles

## AGM-114

The AGM-114 ‘Hellfire’ is an anti-tank laser guided missile. The Hellfire is widely known IRL due to its appearance on airframes like the AH-64 Apache and Predator drone. The AGM-114 is mainly used in VTOL on the AH-94 (For all those Apache larpers). That said, the AV-42 can also carry it. It cannot kill bunkers and is best used against targets that you do not want to get close to.

## AGM-27

The AGM-27 (Previously the PGM-27) is a laser guided missile that is ideal for getting the most out of your valuable pylons. The real-life counterpart to this missile is the APKWS system found on the A-10C and AH-64D. The APKWS system is a guidance package attached to a Hydra-70 rocket allowing for laser guidance to a target. In VTOL VR, you will need a constant TGP LOS (Line Of Sight) to maintain a proper track and gain a kill. Like the Hydra-70, it suffers with a low damage output compared to the other missiles. The trade off for this damage is the sheer amount of missiles you have per pylon. When in operations with narrow budgets, the AGM-27 can be a useful weapon for targeting large quantities of soft targets without running out of munitions. This keeps armaments cheap, and creates room for more engagements within the budget.
