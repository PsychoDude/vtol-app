# AIM-9/9+/9E/92

There are 4 types of the AIM-9 Sidewinder, that being the AIM-9, the AIM-9+, the AIM-9E, and the AIM-92.

The AIM-9 Sidewinder is an infrared homing missile. Within VTOL VR, it is typically used by competitive players to promote learning, positioning, and timing. That said, it is overshadowed by the AIRS-T due to it being inferior in every way. That said, it is still an extremely effective weapon as it is.

The regular AIM-9 is seen on the F/A-26B, T-55, and the AV-42C.

The AIM-9+ is the same as the regular AIM-9, with the only difference being that it has more maneuverability. It is present on the F-45A and the EF-24G.

The AIM-9E is a vietnam era missile, which can only aquire and engage targets from directly behind. It has the same maneuverability as all the other missiles. The game engine recognizes being “behind” a target as being behind the 3-9 line, but it will usually not track when fired from high aspects. Avoid firing until firmly behind the target.

The AIM-92 Stinger is a helicopter based heat seeking missile. It has considerably less power, maneuverability, and damage than any other heat seeking missile. It tends to struggle to catch up on fixed wing aircraft.
