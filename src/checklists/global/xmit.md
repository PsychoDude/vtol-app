**DESCRIPTION:**
The transmitter page is the primary display used to manage and monitor jammer transmitters. It allows operators to view the power ratios, targets, jamming modes, and active jammers at a glance. The page also contains buttons to change the power ratios, jamming modes, and transmissions; allowing the pilot to manage the transmitters without _specialized HOTAS commands_ that are only available to the EWO.
