# SAS Jamming Effects

SAS will receive, modify, and retransmit incoming radar pulses to disguise itself as any desired aircraft. However, due to SAS outputting a higher amount of power than the incoming pulse, the detection range of the jamming platform will drastically increase. It is advised for operators to manually increase/decrease the power output appropriate for the aircraft being emulated. You donâ€™t want to appear 50 miles away while disguising as an F-45!
