# GPS Guided Missiles

GPS guided weapons use GPS coordinates set by the pilot on targets using TGP, EOTS, TSD, TADS or NAV. GPS weapons are great for striking large quantities of targets in a given area within a short amount of time, overwhelming and penetrating air defenses. GPS weapons are also good for large targets, or those with large health pools.

## GBU-39ER

The GBU-39ER is a variant of the GBU-39 exclusively available to the AH-94. To compensate for the AH-94's lack of flight speed, the GBU-39ER features a brief booster stage to propel the bomb forward, allowing it to quickly gain velocity upon deployment.

Failure to stabilize the aircraft and minimize side-slip before launch will likely cause the GBU-39ER to miss its intended target.

## AGM-89

The AGM-89 is a GPS guided Anti-Ship Cruise missile. It has an in-built radar system, which allows it to track sea based targets around oneâ€™s GPS point. It has multiple engagement modes, with the most popular one being SSEvasive. Similarly to the AGM-161, the AGM-89 can be programmed to follow a GPS path. That said, the missile has terrain avoidance built in. This means one can safely deploy the AGM-89 without worry if it striking a mountain or other terrain feature.

## AGM-161

The AGM-161 is a long range GPS guided cruise missile. The AGM-161 has a small engine that lasts for around 32NMs before running out of fuel and gliding towards its target. The AGM-161 can follow GPS paths along with direct flight to a set target. The AGM-161 is great for engaging large SAM groups/IADS and allowing you to take them out before they can even shoot at you. The AGM-161 also has terrain avoidance, meaning it will maneuver over obstacles to avoid hitting the ground. It is typically recommended to obtain a high altitude and speed before deploying the 161 as to increase its range and speed. An increase in speed will increase its chances of survival.
