# Infrared Homing

## “Fox 2”

The Fox 2 is one of two modern missile variants. This missile is an infrared homing missile, meaning it will track heat signatures produced by engines and afterburners or the residual heat of the plane itself. These are generally used in close combat, usually in WVR. This missile is extremely maneuverable, yet cannot travel long distances. You'll see this missile in the form of the _AIM-9_, _AIM-9+_, _AIM-9E_, _AIM-92_, and the _AIRS-T_.

Heat seeking missiles are affected heavily by weather. Infrared radiation cannot travel easily through clouds, making it difficult to gain a track on targets within and around clouds.
