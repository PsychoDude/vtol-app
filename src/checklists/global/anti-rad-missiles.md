# Anti-Radiation Missiles

ARMs, also known as Anti-Radiation Missiles are a classification of missiles that target Electromagnetic radiation that **RADARs** emit. ARMs are the primary missile you will find yourself using against any SAM threat found within the game. ARMs use a **Passive** sensor to engage SAMs. This highlights one of the major disadvantages of ARMs, where they are useless if a SAM site turns off its radar. The passive sensor makes the ARM undetectable besides launch or if found by radar. This passive sensor also allows for the missile to operate entirely on its own after launch, making it FAF (Fire And Forget).

## AGM-88

The AGM-88 HARM (High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile) is used to destroy ground based radar sources. The AGM-88 is a medium ranged HARM. The AGM-88 may be fired from the F/A-26B, F-45A, and the EF-24G. The F-45A and EF-24G has a sub-variant of the AGM-88, being the AGM-88S. Despite having a shorter burn time, the AGM-88S has a similar range than the standard 88 due to its reduced drag. Infact, it is not uncommon for the AGM-88S to have a larger range for that exact reason.

## AGM-126

The AGM-126 ‘SideARM II” Is an ARM built from the body of an AIM-9. The AGM-126 has a short range because of the AIM-9’s short motor. It is the most maneuverable ARM that is available. The 126 is most useful in pop-up attacks where you don’t need to be facing directly towards the target.

## AGM-188

The AGM-188 MARM is an intermediate/medium range ARM that features a unique missile trajectory that is difficult to intercept. It has a 10-20 mile range and has a higher success rate compared to the other ARMs seen here. Its top-down trajectory makes it an effective counter to a well defended SAM. The AGM-188 is only available on the AV-42C and EF-24G.
