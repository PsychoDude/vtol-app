# AIRS-T

The AIRS-T is the most advanced heat seeking missile within VTOL VR. It has more maneuverability, better flare resistance, speed, and range. Ontop of its inherent advantages, it is also capable of tracking onto and intercepting missiles. Due to this mechanic and its said inherent advantages, most competitive players tend to stay away from the AIRS-T. It is believed that the AIRS-T keeps new players from learning how to properly defend missiles and promotes wasteful missile-spammy behavior.
