# ADM-160J MALD

The ADM-160J Miniature Air Launched Decoy - Jam (MALD) is a small jet powered glide missile intended to act as a false target/decoy. The ADM-160J contains a two way Datalink, giving capability to use the MALD as an external EW sensor, and allowing post-launch commands/updates to be sent. MALD is able to be reprogrammed or retasked mid-flight, allowing it to quickly react to new threats and adapt to the battlefield. MALDs have a loiter time of 8 minutes and a max speed of just above 0.9 Mach

 A MALD can be deployed before setting up a path/navigation point, it will fly straight and level based on the aircrafts current heading and altitude. MALDs in flight can have their path updated at any point.

 If no prior setup is done, the MALD will be launched in “COLD” mode, and will not do any jamming/decoy/spoofing. Read below section for setup, which can be done before or after launch.
