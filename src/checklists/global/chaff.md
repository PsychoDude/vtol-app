# CHAFF

**WHAT:** Chaff is a countermeasure consisting of thousands of thin metal fibers deployed by a defending pilot in order to disrupt a missile. The DA attempts to use chaff in a manner that should confuse a radar into thinking the chaff is the target, rather than the aircraft. In order to do this you must be in a beam, otherwise the doppler effect will ruin the illusion and the radar will filter out the chaff.

**WHEN:** Chaffing is only effective when the DA is already in a beam. As such, it is an excellent tactic to use when entering a notch, in conjunction with a notch, or if a notch has failed. Additionally, chaffing is more effective against SARH missiles than other kinematic tactics (like high-G maneuvers) because pilots often struggle to identify and time maneuvers against them.

**HOW:**
Identify the radar you intend to defeat on the RWR (missile, or other locked radar).
Enter a 90 degree BEAM, putting the radar either 3 or 9 o’clock.
Deploy chaff.
While deploying chaff, maneuver in a slow “wiggling” pattern that moves the target radar +- 5 deg of the 90 deg beam.
Even if deploying chaff doesn’t break lock, it can greatly reduce the missile’s accuracy in the terminal phase.
