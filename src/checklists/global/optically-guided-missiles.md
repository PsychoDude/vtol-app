# Optically Guided Missiles

Optically guided weapons use internal imaging systems to find, track, and kill targets independent from the attacking aircraft. This means these weapons are FAF (Fire And Forget), where one can stop tracking the target after launching the missile.

## AGM-65

The AGM-65 ‘Maverick’ is an optically guided FAF general purpose missile. The AGM-65 is a real missile that has been used since the Vietnam War and is combat proven. The AGM-65 is able to kill bunkers (Unlike the AGM-145 seen on the F-45A). The missile is cheap, yet effective. You only get a single missile per pylon unless you use a triple rack pylon. The AGM-65 may be fired from the AV-42C, F/A-26B, and the T-55. The AGM-65 is quite popular due to its ease of use, and its capability of destroying bunkers.

## AGM-145

The AGM-145 is the primary optically guided AGM for the F-45A and AH-94. The AGM-145 is based on the Brimstone missile used by the Royal Air Force. Unlike the Brimstone missile, the AGM-145 is optically guided. It is an extremely advanced missile featuring lock-on after launch (LOAL) as well as being a fire and forget weapon. Unlike the AGM-65, the 145 is not capable of killing bunkers. The AGM-145’s LOAL capabilities allow for it to be fired behind terrain and it will automatically find and engage targets of opportunity. You can use the LOAL capabilities to quickly ripple off multiple 145’s in different directions of a city and be able to get quick and easy kills.

## CAGM-6

The CAGM-6 is one of two cluster munitions seen within VTOL VR. The CAGM-6 shares a close resemblance to the BK-90, a Swedish cluster munition. The CAGM-6 will deploy six submunitions once it gets close to the target. As the sub-munitions are small, these will have little to no effect on tanks unless you fire multiple CAGM-6s at the target. The CAGM-6 is amazing against unarmored units in close proximity whether it be a SAM site or an infantry squad.
