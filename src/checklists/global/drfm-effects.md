# DRFM Jamming Effects

- **Search:** Employing DRFM on a threat radar in search mode will create multiple false contacts surrounding the jamming platform. Having multiple jammers in DRFM on the same threat will further increase the amount of fake contacts. Note: One max-powered transmitter will create 3 false contacts.
- **STT:** Employing DRFM on a threat radar in STT will initiate RGPO. RGPO will attempt to break an STT, and has an effect similar to chaffâ€™s effect on threat radars.
