# Flaring

Fox 2s or Heat seeking missiles can be easily defeated using flares. Flares create an artificial heat signature intended to distract the missile away from your engines and towards itself. Flares do not work if you keep your engine hot by throwing fuel into it, so throttle down before dispensing flares. This especially goes for afterburners. It does no good to have a fire shooting out of the back of your aircraft when you’re trying to defend a heat seeking missile. You’ll likely notice that when you defend heat seeking missiles, the MWS warning will flip to the other side of the RWR as the missile passes. This becomes an excellent sign of a successfully defended missile. Missiles such as the AIRS-T and the AIM-9+ can be extremely for dual engine aircraft. To defend these missiles

- Throttle down to reduce your heat signature
- Dispense flares in small, tight, dense patches
- Avoid moving or rolling while flaring.
- Move away after you flare

If you continuously dispense flares nonstop, the missile will continuously bite the most recent flare you dispensed. This creates a line of heat signatures that lead directly back to your own aircraft. Rolling and moving while flaring causes your flares to get spread out, becoming less dense and thus less effective towards more modern missiles.
