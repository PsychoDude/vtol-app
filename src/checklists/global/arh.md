# Active Radar Homing

## “Fox 3”

The Fox 3 is the other modern missile variant and is arguably one of the best missiles. These have a radar built into the missile itself, allowing the missile to guide itself into the target after obtaining a lock without the help of the launching plane. That said, it will use the plane’s radar at first when you launch it. You'll hear a "Pitbull" audio cue when it starts tracking independently. This missile travels medium to long distances, and is decently maneuverable. You'll see this missile in the form of the _AIM-120C/D_ and the _AIM-54_. Do keep in mind that fox 3 missiles will not prevent you from targeting and firing upon friendly targets, and they will still pitbull on friendlies. Keep this in mind when firing into groups of both bandits and friendlies.

Fox 3s also have a “Maddog” mode (enabled within the Equip page) where the missile can be fired straight ahead without any guidance. This is useful for creating areas of denial, or for catching enemies off guard as the pass from behind a mountain.
