# Unguided Missiles

Unguided weaponry are weapons that do not have form of internal or external guidance, acting entirely from the pilotâ€™s aiming.

## Hydra 70

The Hydra-70 is a rocket pod seen on the AV-42, F/A-26B, T-55, and AH-94. The Hydra has an IRL counterpart and is mostly used against infantry and unarmored targets. The Hydra is a very simple to use rocket pod. The F/A-26B has a 7 and 14 count variant with other airframes having a larger selection. The Hydra-70s are a cheap and useful weapon when it comes into contact with infantry and light targets, but you will have a challenge with anything with armor. The Hydra-70 is unable to kill bunkers.
