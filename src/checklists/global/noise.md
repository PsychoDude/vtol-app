# Noise

The simplest form of radar degradation is noise jamming. Noise jamming is carried out by an emitter continuously transmitting a bombardment of noise on the frequency band a target radar is operating on. Low band noise can heavily disrupt the reception of GPS, radio communications, and early-warning radars; while mid and high band noise can disrupt fire control radars.

- **Burn-through Range:** Burn-through range is the range where a radar can overcome the effect of jamming. The range is a function of the target’s radar cross section, jamming power output, and the threat radar’s power output.

- **Jamming Corridors:** The Jamming corridor is a region of airspace drawn along the azimuth of the jamming source and the target that is being jammed. Allies must be within the corridor to enjoy the benefits of noise jamming.

- **Stand-Off Jamming:** Jamming done from behind friendly assets. Most commonly done by EW aircraft carrying high-powered jamming pods.

- **Stand-In Jamming:** Jamming done in between friendly assets and the threat radar. Most commonly done by MALDs.

- **Home-On-Jam (HOJ):** The ability of some A2A missiles and SAMs to use received jamming energy to guide to the jammer. The missile guidance is degraded due to a lack of ranging information.
